Oops:
Object oriented programming language
->Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology 
 to design a program using classes and objects.
Some concepts:
1.Object:it is a instance of a class
2.class:It is a collection of methods and variables
3.Inheritance:It is to acquire the methods and 
              variables from parent or super class.
The relationship between the two classes is Programmer IS-A Employee.
Types of inheritance:Single level,mutli level,hybrid level
Hierarchial level,multiple level
*Note: Multiple inheritance is not 
supported in Java through class.
Reason:To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, 
multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
**Aggregation in Java:If a class have an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation.
 Aggregation represents HAS-A relationship.
example:
class Employee{  
int id;  
String name;  
Address address;//Address is a class  
...  
}  
4.Abstraction:Abstraction lets you focus on what the object
 does instead of how it does it.
5.Encapsulation:Capsulating or covering logical things
Generaly it act as a cover even a class is a encapsulation ,as
it covers variables i.e,properties and methods
6.Polymorphism:object behaves different in different situations
Types:1)Method overloading,2)Method overriding
1)Method which has same method but different parameters-overloading
2)Method which has same method name but different implementation-overriding
*Covariant Return Type :It is a return type overloading process
In which methods name will be same but different return type
and different parameters as it is a overloading
*The super keyword can also be used to invoke parent class method and parent class variables.
